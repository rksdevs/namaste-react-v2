1. React elements are not HTML elements, but these are js objects
2. When these react elements are rendered - they become html elements
3. JSX - JSX is not HTML but HTML-like or XML-like syntax, which helps us to write react codes in a more readable manner
4. JSX code is not pure JS code
5. Before our code is sent to the browser, the bundler transpiles our code, so the JS engine can understand it
6. JSX code is transpiled by Parcel using Babel library
7. Babel library is a compiler or transpiler, which transpiles or compiles ECMAScript2015+ code to backward compatible JS
8. Babel converts our JSX code to React.createElement which creates a JS object
9. Almost everything in a react web site is a component - nav bar, search box, header, footer etc etc
10. React components are of two types - Class based component (old way) and Functional Components (new way)
11. React Functional components are nothing but a regular JS function.
12. A function which returns some JSX code (otherwise a react element) is a react functional component. Naming Conventions - always start with Capitals
13. Using curly braces allows us to execute any JS codes within our JSX code
14. This might be used for cross site scripting attacks, but JSX takes care of this by sanitizing the scripts that are run inside JSX
